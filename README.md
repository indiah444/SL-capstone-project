# SL-capstone-project
Repository for the capstone project of the Sigma Labs pre-work course

In this repository, there are two files: one for a standard Magic 8 Ball (magic8ball.py), and another for a biased Magic 8 Ball (biasedmagic8ball.py).

The standard Magic 8 Ball works as such: simply ask it a question and it will give you a random answer. You have the option of not asking it a question at all, or asking multiple questions. 

The biased Magic 8 Ball works in a similar way, except this Magic 8 Ball has had its heart broken, and is cynical towards love. So, ask it a question to do with romance and it will give you a negative or non-commital answer. Ask it about anything else, and it will work in the same way as the standard Magic 8 Ball.
